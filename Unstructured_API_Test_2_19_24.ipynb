        "# The Unstructured Core API consists of the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Partitioning: The partitioning functions in Unstructured enable the extraction of structured content from raw, unstructured documents. Partitioning functions in unstructured allow users to extract structured content from a raw unstructured document. These functions break a document down into elements such as Title, NarrativeText, and ListItem, enabling users to decide what content they’d like to keep for their particular application. If you’re training a summarization model, for example, you may only be interested in NarrativeText.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cleaning: Data preparation for NLP models often requires cleaning to ensure quality. The Unstructured library includes cleaning functions that assist in sanitizing output, removing unwanted content, and improving the performance of NLP models. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity of data before it is passed to downstream applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Extracting: This functionality allows for the extraction of specific entities within documents. It is designed to identify and isolate relevant pieces of information, making it easier for users to focus on the most pertinent data in their documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Staging: Staging functions help prepare your data for ingestion into downstream systems. Please note that this functionality is being deprecated in favor of Destination Connectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Chunking: The chunking process in Unstructured is distinct from conventional methods. Instead of relying solely on text-based features to form chunks, Unstructured uses a deep understanding of document formats to partition documents into semantic units (document elements).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Embedding: The embedding encoder classes in Unstructured leverage document elements detected through partitioning or grouped via chunking to obtain embeddings for each element. This is particularly useful for applications like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where precise and contextually relevant embeddings are crucial."

Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.')"

Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel.')"

The ex-KGB lieutenant colonel, who conceived a grievance after watching the Soviet Union dissolve from his outpost in East Germany, has sparked chaos in a single-minded effort to discredit and weaken the United States. Successive US presidents have underestimated Russia, misread its historic humiliations and struggled to work out how to change Putin’s course and contain his threat.\\n\\nWestern observers often point out that Putin’s leadership has been a disaster for Russia. As oligarchs plundered natural resources, Russians were hammered by international sanctions, democracy was crushed and thousands of soldiers perished in his wars.\\n\\nBut Putin has been remarkably resilient following earlier signs that his invasion of Ukraine – nearly two years ago –\\xa0was a disaster and could even bring him down. There are now signs that Russia’s reconstituting of its armed forces and willingness to absorb horrendous losses are turning the tide of the war and raising the prospect of a victory that would turn Putin into a far greater danger.\\n\\nThe Russian leader’s leveraging of power and successful forays into US politics are, meanwhile, threatening to cause a schism between the US and European NATO allies that could put the post-World War II security architecture at risk.\\n\\nAll the ways Putin is playing in US politics\\n\\nPutin is advancing Russian interests against the US on multiple fronts.\\n\\nBiden once tried to save US-Russia relations\\n\\nBiden is just the latest president to be confronted by a national security migraine because of Putin.\\n\\nYet it wasn’t always this way. Early in his tenure, Putin sought cooperation. He was one of the first world leaders to call President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Bush famously once looked into Putin’s eyes and said he got “a sense of his soul” — one of the many catastrophic misjudgments of the Russian leader by presidents in the 21st century. President Barack Obama attempted a “reset” of relations with Moscow. But after a period as prime minister, Putin returned to the presidency and became increasingly hostile toward the West. The Russian leader was particularly incensed by the US-led operation to topple Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Obama’s critics now say he did too little to respond to Putin’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and paved the way for Russia’s full invasion two years ago.\\n\\nTrump came to office haunted by allegations that his team colluded with Russia’s effort to damage 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. A probe by special counsel Robert Mueller did not find evidence of conspiring between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the special counsel did detail multiple contacts between the two and wrote that the Trump campaign believed it would benefit from information stolen and released by the Russians. Whether Russia helped Trump win is impossible to say. But the subsequent fallout forever soured the new president on US intelligence agencies that he regarded as a hostile “Deep State” and led him to torch their credibility among his millions of supporters. This whipping up of domestic antagonism and the damage to US institutions plays into Russia’s goals. And the spectacle of Trump, as president at a Helsinki summit, siding with Putin and trashing US intelligence agencies over their claims of election interference remains one of the most staggering moments in the history of US-Russia relations.\\n\\nWhen Biden took over, he made a high-stakes bid to reduce the poison from relations with Moscow, meeting Putin in Geneva in an echo of old Cold War summitry. Approaching the talks with deep skepticism, Biden sought to halt Russian cybersecurity attacks and to reopen nuclear disarmament negotiations while trying to ease the risks of an accidental war.\\n\\n“We’ll find out within the next six months to a year whether or not we actually have a strategic dialogue that matters,” Biden said after the meeting in June 2021.\\n\\nIt was not much more than six months later that he got his answer, when Putin invaded Ukraine, a sovereign, democratic neighbor, which led to what has effectively become a proxy war between Biden and a Kremlin leader who has said he sees the conflict as part of a wider clash with the United States and the West.\\n\\nPutin’s efforts to weaken US power have only escalated since.\\n\\nRussia’s use of espionage agencies to inject propaganda and discord in US politics through social media and more directly by intelligence agencies was described by Mueller in his final report as an effort “designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States.”\\n\\nIronically, those efforts use two of America’s great innovations — its open, adversarial, democratic political system and the computer technology that empowered the internet – in an attempt to bring it down.\\n\\nAnd as recent days have shown, the Russian leader can always rely on one priceless resource – the reflex of American politicians to turn on one another in a way that makes his threat even stronger.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

The pair had been on a four-day holiday to Istanbul. She went on to Russia, while he returned to California - and that’s when he discovered she had been detained.\\n\\nAt first, he said, her detention was only brief. Russian authorities took her cell phone then released her and she was able to see her family and contact him.\\n\\nEven three weeks later, just before she was due to return to the US, Karelina had told Van Heerden that things were okay, that authorities had said she could leave the country and that “I can come and get my phone.”\\n\\nThe former boxing champion never heard back from Karelina, an esthetician who had for years been a “semi-pro ballerina.”\\n\\nKarelina was arrested in Yekaterinburg on charges of treason for allegedly donating just $51 to a Ukrainian charity, according to the spa in California where she worked.\\n\\nRussia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed she had been “providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against Russia security.”\\n\\nBut Van Heerden said his girlfriend was “so proud to be Russian,” and that she never spoke about Russia’s two-year invasion of Ukraine – “she doesn’t watch the news, she doesn’t intervene with anything,” he said.\\n\\nIf found guilty, Karelina could face a possible 20 years in prison, an idea Van Heerden said she would find particularly hard as she was “so full of life.”\\n\\nA Tuesday hearing on her case was postponed due to Karelina not having legal representation. Her boyfriend said lawyers were “afraid to just touch” her case, adding that they had found one that was willing to help but only for “an insane amount of money.”\\n\\nA GoFundMe page has been set up to help with the fees.\\n\\nDespite it all Van Heerden said he was hopeful the US would not give up on her. “I believe in America. I do believe that America will bring her back to me and that’s the hope I’m holding on to,” he said.\\n\\nHeld as leverage?\\n\\nCommenting on Karelina’s case, the Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov told CNN that the main goal of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) was “to build up a bank of hostages with American passports.”\\n\\nHe said Moscow would use it “as leverage” in any future negotiations with Russia.\\n\\nMoscow has detained several US citizens in recent years, and Karelina’s arrest came on the same day that the Moscow City Court upheld American journalist\\xa0Evan Gershkovich’s\\xa0extended pre-trial detention until March 30.\\n\\nGershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, was arrested in Yekaterinburg in March last year on charges of espionage, which he, his employer and the US government have strenuously denied. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\\n\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin recently\\xa0suggested\\xa0“an agreement can be reached” with the US to exchange Gershkovich for Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany for murdering a former Chechen fighter in Berlin in 2019.\\n\\n“Listen, I’ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,” Putin said in an interview earlier this month with the right-wing American pundit Tucker Carlson.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.
