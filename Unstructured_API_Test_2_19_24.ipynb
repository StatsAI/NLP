        "# The Unstructured Core API consists of the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Partitioning: The partitioning functions in Unstructured enable the extraction of structured content from raw, unstructured documents. Partitioning functions in unstructured allow users to extract structured content from a raw unstructured document. These functions break a document down into elements such as Title, NarrativeText, and ListItem, enabling users to decide what content they’d like to keep for their particular application. If you’re training a summarization model, for example, you may only be interested in NarrativeText.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cleaning: Data preparation for NLP models often requires cleaning to ensure quality. The Unstructured library includes cleaning functions that assist in sanitizing output, removing unwanted content, and improving the performance of NLP models. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity of data before it is passed to downstream applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Extracting: This functionality allows for the extraction of specific entities within documents. It is designed to identify and isolate relevant pieces of information, making it easier for users to focus on the most pertinent data in their documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Staging: Staging functions help prepare your data for ingestion into downstream systems. Please note that this functionality is being deprecated in favor of Destination Connectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Chunking: The chunking process in Unstructured is distinct from conventional methods. Instead of relying solely on text-based features to form chunks, Unstructured uses a deep understanding of document formats to partition documents into semantic units (document elements).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Embedding: The embedding encoder classes in Unstructured leverage document elements detected through partitioning or grouped via chunking to obtain embeddings for each element. This is particularly useful for applications like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where precise and contextually relevant embeddings are crucial."

Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.')"

Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel.')"

            "The article discusses how Russian President Vladimir Putin has been able to exert influence and cause division within the United States. Despite facing criticism and sanctions, Putin has remained resilient and has successfully exploited American political divides. His actions have not only threatened US security but also strained relations between the US and its European NATO allies. The article highlights Putin's use of espionage and propaganda to provoke discord in US politics, and the vulnerability of American politicians to turning against each other, which strengthens Putin's threat.\n",

            "European leaders are increasingly concerned about the United States' commitment to their defense, particularly in the face of Russian aggression. Former President Donald Trump's failure to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin and his opposition to aid for Ukraine have raised fears that the US is abandoning its allies. European leaders are now considering how to defend themselves without relying on the American nuclear and security umbrella. Steps are already being taken, such as the creation of Europe's first commissioner of defense and increasing European defense production. European countries are also surpassing the US in commitments to Ukraine. The issue of nuclear weapons is also being considered, with France suggesting a \"clear European dimension\" to nuclear deterrence. European leaders are determined to build a combat-effective Europe that can provide for its own defense and deter Russian aggression.\n",

            "Andrey Morozov, a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger, has died by suicide shortly after reporting significant Russian losses in the assault on the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka. Morozov had claimed that Russia lost around 16,000 soldiers and 300 armored vehicles during the assault. His death comes amid a crackdown on military bloggers by the Kremlin, following the arrest of another pro-war blogger, Igor Girkin, last month. The true casualty numbers of Russia's invasion of Ukraine remain unknown, but Western officials estimate that over 300,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured since the invasion began.\n",

            "The US Justice Department has announced criminal and civil actions against sanctioned Russian oligarchs and others accused of supporting the Kremlin and its military. The actions, carried out by the Justice Department's Task Force KleptoCapture, aim to target the wealth networks surrounding Russian oligarchs and Kremlin insiders. The task force has brought about 70 criminal cases and five criminal cases against corporate entities, resulting in arrests and the seizure of approximately $700 million worth of assets. The Justice Department hopes to transfer these assets to Ukraine or use them for aid. The announcement comes ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The White House is also expected to announce a new sanctions package against Russia, holding President Vladimir Putin accountable for the war in Ukraine and the death of opposition figure Alexey Navalny.\n",

            "As Ukraine marks the second anniversary of Russia's invasion, Europe is facing difficult questions about its financial support for Ukraine. The war has been deadlocked for some time, and fatigue is setting in as the bills grow. The EU and its regional allies have spent over $100 billion funding Ukraine's defense effort, and the UK has pledged over $15 billion. However, as the conflict continues and political attention is diverted to other issues, spending on Ukraine could become politically harder to justify. The prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House also raises concerns about the future of US support for Ukraine. European officials believe it is crucial to continue supporting Ukraine, even if the US pulls financial support. They suggest using frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine and increasing European defense capabilities. The goal is for Europe to become more independent in terms of security and defense.\n",

The ex-KGB lieutenant colonel, who conceived a grievance after watching the Soviet Union dissolve from his outpost in East Germany, has sparked chaos in a single-minded effort to discredit and weaken the United States. Successive US presidents have underestimated Russia, misread its historic humiliations and struggled to work out how to change Putin’s course and contain his threat.\\n\\nWestern observers often point out that Putin’s leadership has been a disaster for Russia. As oligarchs plundered natural resources, Russians were hammered by international sanctions, democracy was crushed and thousands of soldiers perished in his wars.\\n\\nBut Putin has been remarkably resilient following earlier signs that his invasion of Ukraine – nearly two years ago –\\xa0was a disaster and could even bring him down. There are now signs that Russia’s reconstituting of its armed forces and willingness to absorb horrendous losses are turning the tide of the war and raising the prospect of a victory that would turn Putin into a far greater danger.\\n\\nThe Russian leader’s leveraging of power and successful forays into US politics are, meanwhile, threatening to cause a schism between the US and European NATO allies that could put the post-World War II security architecture at risk.\\n\\nAll the ways Putin is playing in US politics\\n\\nPutin is advancing Russian interests against the US on multiple fronts.\\n\\nBiden once tried to save US-Russia relations\\n\\nBiden is just the latest president to be confronted by a national security migraine because of Putin.\\n\\nYet it wasn’t always this way. Early in his tenure, Putin sought cooperation. He was one of the first world leaders to call President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Bush famously once looked into Putin’s eyes and said he got “a sense of his soul” — one of the many catastrophic misjudgments of the Russian leader by presidents in the 21st century. President Barack Obama attempted a “reset” of relations with Moscow. But after a period as prime minister, Putin returned to the presidency and became increasingly hostile toward the West. The Russian leader was particularly incensed by the US-led operation to topple Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Obama’s critics now say he did too little to respond to Putin’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and paved the way for Russia’s full invasion two years ago.\\n\\nTrump came to office haunted by allegations that his team colluded with Russia’s effort to damage 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. A probe by special counsel Robert Mueller did not find evidence of conspiring between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the special counsel did detail multiple contacts between the two and wrote that the Trump campaign believed it would benefit from information stolen and released by the Russians. Whether Russia helped Trump win is impossible to say. But the subsequent fallout forever soured the new president on US intelligence agencies that he regarded as a hostile “Deep State” and led him to torch their credibility among his millions of supporters. This whipping up of domestic antagonism and the damage to US institutions plays into Russia’s goals. And the spectacle of Trump, as president at a Helsinki summit, siding with Putin and trashing US intelligence agencies over their claims of election interference remains one of the most staggering moments in the history of US-Russia relations.\\n\\nWhen Biden took over, he made a high-stakes bid to reduce the poison from relations with Moscow, meeting Putin in Geneva in an echo of old Cold War summitry. Approaching the talks with deep skepticism, Biden sought to halt Russian cybersecurity attacks and to reopen nuclear disarmament negotiations while trying to ease the risks of an accidental war.\\n\\n“We’ll find out within the next six months to a year whether or not we actually have a strategic dialogue that matters,” Biden said after the meeting in June 2021.\\n\\nIt was not much more than six months later that he got his answer, when Putin invaded Ukraine, a sovereign, democratic neighbor, which led to what has effectively become a proxy war between Biden and a Kremlin leader who has said he sees the conflict as part of a wider clash with the United States and the West.\\n\\nPutin’s efforts to weaken US power have only escalated since.\\n\\nRussia’s use of espionage agencies to inject propaganda and discord in US politics through social media and more directly by intelligence agencies was described by Mueller in his final report as an effort “designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States.”\\n\\nIronically, those efforts use two of America’s great innovations — its open, adversarial, democratic political system and the computer technology that empowered the internet – in an attempt to bring it down.\\n\\nAnd as recent days have shown, the Russian leader can always rely on one priceless resource – the reflex of American politicians to turn on one another in a way that makes his threat even stronger.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

Andelman\\n\\nUpdated: \\n        7:20 AM EST, Thu February 22, 2024\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nMadeline Albright famously called America the “indispensable nation.”\\u202fIs former President Donald Trump\\u202fmaking America\\u202fthe\\u202firrelevant nation?\\n\\nTrump finally broke\\xa0days of silence\\xa0on\\xa0Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny’s death but failed to mention Russia or condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin in his first public comments. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans have continued to follow his lead, stalemating assistance for Ukraine, the one nation standing up to Putin’s armies.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson\\u202fhas resisted calls to bring a Senate-passed aid package for Ukraine up for a quick vote, instead allowing the House to adjourn for a nearly two-week recess.\\n\\nThere may be majority support for Ukraine aid\\u202fin the chamber as whole, but\\u202fJohnson faces stiff opposition\\u202ffrom his right flank over additional aid, with Trump urging Republicans to reject it.\\n\\nThese moves followed\\u202fTrump’s recent threat to tell Russia\\u202fto “do whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member nations who lag in their military spending.\\n\\nThe result? Rising fears of a new and frightening turn in the United States have left an increasing number of European leaders determined to strike out on their own.\\n\\nEven comments from\\u202fPresident\\u202fJoe Biden addressed to a recalcitrant Congress\\u202fsuch as\\u202f“the way they’re walking away from the threat of Russia, the way they’re walking away from\\xa0the threat of\\xa0NATO, the way they’re walking away from meeting our obligation, it’s\\xa0shocking,” haven’t helped.\\n\\nIndeed, much was made at the annual Munich Security Conference over congressional failures.\\xa0Most European leaders headed home from Munich, more convinced than ever that the United States is on the cusp of abandoning them.\\n\\nFor many, it is clear democracies must begin considering in concrete terms how to defend themselves without the American nuclear and security umbrella under which they have thrived for more than a half century.\\n\\nBefore leaving,\\u202fDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\\u202feven announced her country would be handing over all her nation’s artillery to Ukraine as well as F-16 fighters. “We\\xa0 have to\\xa0do more,”\\xa0Frederiksen said, as\\xa0Saturday marks the two-year anniversary\\xa0of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nThe first steps toward a new direction for such a Europe — without America — are already being taken. In Berlin,\\u202fUrsula von der Leyen, the former German defense minister who has deftly steered the continent for five fraught years as the European Commission’s\\u202fpresident, announced\\u202fMonday that she would be seeking a second term. High on her agenda, she says, would be the creation of Europe’s first\\u202fcommissioner of defense.\\n\\nCreating such a pan-European ministry goes far beyond simply reshuffling bureaucrats in Brussels, however. First, there’s the question of budgets.\\n\\nAlready, America’s\\xa0reduced\\xa0funding is being felt across Europe. As\\u202fCNN reported, American support of Ukraine is still bleeding resources from the US Army’s Europe and Africa Command, now left with $3 billion to fund $5 billion in operational needs including the ferrying of weapons and equipment to Ukraine and even NATO member Poland.\\n\\nWithout congressional action, funding for US operations in Europe could run out in May, with\\u202fArmy Secretary Christine\\u202fWormuth\\u202fexpecting\\xa0the Army would\\u202f“have to sort of rob Peter to pay Paul.”\\n\\nVon der Leyen has also said that upping European defense production would be a top priority for her second term — not to mention sorting through vastly divergent budgets of the various countries.\\n\\nWith respect to Ukraine, despite his\\xa0initial\\xa0 protestations of eternal solidarity, \\u202fFrench President Emmanuel Macron’s government\\xa0has committed just\\xa0640 million euros ($686 million),\\xa0compared with Germany’s\\xa017.7 billion euros ($19.1 billion) in military aid, according to calculations from\\xa0Germany’s Kiel Institute, an economic research institute and think tank. \\xa0Although the French figure has been disputed, the institute does say “France’s contributions “are far below the UK’s,” which is only in the middle rank of European suppliers.\\n\\nStill, as a bloc, Europe at about 85 billion euros ($92 billion) has already passed\\xa0the United States at 66.2 billion euros\\xa0($71.6 billion)\\xa0in total commitments to Ukraine. US military assistance has been higher than the EU’s has been, though this has now been halted in the face of Congressional inaction while EU aid is only accelerating.\\n\\nThen there is the nuclear issue. The US has an estimated\\u202f100 nuclear weapons\\u202fdeployed at air bases in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey — though all launch codes are in US hands. France is the only European Union country with its own arsenal — the world’s fourth largest. With\\u202f290 operational warheads, it’s the largest in Europe, though barely 5 percent the size of Russia’s.\\n\\nFrance has refused to cede control of such weapons to any other power, though that could change. In a recent visit to Sweden,\\u202fMacron suggested\\u202fthat while nuclear deterrence is in “France’s vital interests,” such plans should have a “clear European dimension, which gives us a special responsibility.”\\n\\nBritain, while no longer in the EU, has an arsenal of\\u202f225 nuclear weapons. At the Munich Security Conference, the shadow (opposition) British Foreign Secretary\\u202fDavid Lammy\\u202fsaid his Labour Party, if elected in elections this year, would propose “a new U.K.-EU security pact.”\\n\\nAll these efforts and pledges represent a dramatic change in direction for a continent that for decades has remained chained unflinchingly to America as its guarantor. To oversee this process, Europe needs a strong and resolute individual for its first defense czar.\\n\\nOne front-runner is Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who’s already taken the lead in a EU plan to deliver\\u202f1 million artillery shells\\u202fto Ukraine.\\n\\n“We need a combat-effective Europe, able to provide for its own defense. This is the only way to build deterrence by denial that would be credible enough to avoid war and stop Russia’s cycle of aggression,”\\u202fKallas wrote last year\\xa0for Politico Europe.\\n\\n“Since the invasion began, we have seen Russia fire Europe’s monthly artillery production in a single day in Ukraine. Capacity and sustainability will determine the outcome of this war.”\\n\\nKallas has a clear motivation in taking on such a post — a Russian bull’s-eye on her back. Last week, the Kremlin placed her on\\u202fa wanted list, apparently the first head of government to be targeted. (It accused her and others of destroying or damaging monuments in memory of Soviet soldiers.) And at Munich, she\\u202fproposed seizing all of Russia’s assets\\u202ffrozen abroad and\\u202fturning them over to Ukraine\\u202f— before November’s US presidential election.\\n\\nThe most graphic evidence, though, of just how far Europe is moving away from America and toward self-sufficiency was an opinion column Monday by Estonian President Alar Karis that discussed the region’s defense without a single reference to the United States or Donald Trump.\\n\\n“Any European country would struggle to face Russia alone,”\\u202fKaris observed. “But when we’re united, we’re invincible.”\\n\\nOr in a direct slap at Trump,\\u202fGerman magazine Der Spiegel\\xa0noted: “NATO, of course, is not a (debt) collection agency.”\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

After the post drew severe criticism from Russian propagandists, Morozov said he had been forced to delete the post but did not specify who gave the order.\\n\\nSeveral well informed pro-Russian military bloggers and Russian state media reported Wednesday that Morozov had died by suicide. His lawyer and friend, Maxim Pashkov, confirmed his death and said he had spoken to Morozov the day before.\\n\\n“We spoke with him at night, two or three hours before what happened. We agreed to write it off in the morning,” Pashkov wrote Wednesday on Telegram. “You were a true friend.”\\n\\nMorozov had written a series of posts on Wednesday morning announcing his apparent intention to take his own life. He called on his readers not to mourn him and asked that he be buried in the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) – the Russian name for the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, whose annexation by Moscow is considered illegal by most of the international community.\\n\\nSpurred partly by the abortive mutiny last year of former Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin last year, the Kremlin has cracked down on military bloggers like Morozov, who had previously enjoyed some freedom to analyze and sometimes criticize the way Russia’s Defense Ministry is waging war in Ukraine.\\n\\nIgor Girkin, another Russian pro-war blogger, was sentenced last month to four years in prison by a Moscow court after being found on extremism charges. Girkin had played a crucial role in Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in 2014, but was arrested in July after becoming increasingly critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his military’s mishaps in Ukraine.\\n\\nRussia’s true casualty numbers remain shrouded in secrecy, but Western officials believe Russia has had more than 300,000 troops killed or injured on the battlefields of Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began nearly two years ago.\\n\\nA source familiar with a declassified US intelligence assessment provided in December to Congress told CNN that Russia has lost a staggering 87 percent of the total number of active-duty ground troops it had prior to launching its invasion of Ukraine and two-thirds of its pre-invasion tanks. Moscow has been able to offset some of these losses by boosting the size of its army and ramping up domestic production of armored vehicles.\\n\\nCNN has seen evidence that Russia suffered heavy casualties during its offensive on Avdiivka, but cannot verify the estimates published by Morozov.\\n\\nThe Ukrainian retreat from Avdiivka marked Russia’s first significant territorial gain in months, won partly through Ukraine’s dwindling supplies of weapons and ammunition due to the US Congress’ not passing a $60 billion package of aid.\\n\\nIn his final messages, Morozov complained he was being bullied because of his report and said he was ordered to delete the post by someone he described as “Comrade Colonel.”\\n\\n“Your command forced you to give this order, relying on good old army collective responsibility. If he doesn’t remove it, we won’t provide supplies,” Morozov wrote. In his last few posts, he complained about the shortage of weapons for Russian troops at the front and also shared his will.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

              "  Document(page_content='CNN\\n\\n2/22/2024\\n\\nJustice Department announces criminal and civil actions against sanctioned Russian oligarchs\\n\\nBy Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN\\n\\nUpdated: \\n        2:23 PM EST, Thu February 22, 2024\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nThe Justice Department on Thursday announced a sweeping set of criminal and civil enforcement actions targeting sanctioned Russian oligarchs and others accused of working to support the Kremlin and its military.\\n\\nThe announcement, made by the Justice Department’s\\xa0Task Force KleptoCapture, comes days before the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nThe task force — made up of federal prosecutors, investigators, and analysts — has targeted the web of wealth surrounding Russian oligarchs and Kremlin insiders.\\xa0In the two years since Russia’s invasion, the task force has brought about 70 criminal cases against individuals and five criminal cases against corporate entities. More than a dozen of those charged have been arrested worldwide, department officials said.\\n\\nThe task force has also moved to seize about $700 million worth of assets, which Justice Department officials said they hope to ultimately transfer to Ukraine or use in aid. While the bulk of that money is still in the process of being forfeited, department officials said, about $6 million has been transferred to Ukraine thus far.\\n\\nAs the Justice Department works to enforce existing sanctions, the White House is also set to announce a new sanctions package against Russia on Friday,\\xa0CNN has reported. The sanctions are aimed to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable for Russia’s war in Ukraine — which hits the 2-year mark on Saturday — and\\xa0for the death of opposition figure Alexey Navalny, US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.\\n\\nDavid Lim, one of the co-directors of the task force, said Thursday that he hopes the enforcement actions demonstrate the department’s “commitment and resolve to enforcing our laws in the hopes that we are able to play a role in supporting the Ukrainian people.”\\n\\n“What you have seen through today’s public announcement are our efforts at really targeting the facilitators who possess the requisite skill set, access, connections that allowed the Russian war machine, the Russian elites, to continually see have access to western services and western goods,” Lim said.\\n\\nAttorney General Merrick Garland, meanwhile, said in a statement that the Justice Department “is more committed than ever to cutting off the flow of illegal funds that are fueling Putin’s war and to holding accountable those who continue to enable it.”\\n\\nAs part of Thursday’s announcement, the Justice Department unveiled two cases out of Florida. In the first case, prosecutors announced criminal charges against a pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch accused doing more than $300 million in business in violation of US sanctions.\\n\\nProsecutors also filed a civil forfeiture complaint against two luxury condos in Miami that they say are owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Perevalov. The properties are located at the Ritz-Carlton, prosecutors said, and are valued at approximately $2.5 million.\\n\\nIn New York, prosecutors announced charges against another sanctioned Russian oligarch accused of laundering money to “support two superyachts.” The oligarch, Andrey Kostin, and two US-based individuals are also charged with scheming to evade US sanctions by concealing Kostin’s ownership of an apartment in Aspen, Colorado, and working to update the apartment. The three also tried to sell the home for $12 million.\\n\\nThe department brought additional charges against Vladislav Osipov, a dual Russian and Swiss national accused of hiding his ownership of a 255-foot luxury yacht named “Tango” in violation of US sanctions.\\n\\nAnd in Georgia, prosecutors secured a guilty plea from Atlanta-based dual national Feliks Medvedev for his role in an alleged plot to launder more than $150 million through bank accounts and shell companies on behalf of Russian clients.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

It also reflects several current grim truths.\\n\\nThe war has\\xa0been deadlocked for\\xa0some time,\\xa0while\\xa0last week,\\xa0Ukraine\\xa0was forced to withdraw from the key town of Avdiivka after months of fierce fighting, marking its worst defeat since the fall of Bakhmut in May.\\n\\nMoney desperately needed from the United\\xa0States\\xa0is stuck, having passed the Senate but awaiting House approval. Unity between the European\\xa0Union\\xa0(EU)\\xa0and NATO\\xa0is starting to fray, with nearly every big decision held up and threatened with veto.\\n\\nNo serious Western voices want to abandon\\xa0Kyiv, but it’s undeniable that fatigue is setting in as the bills grow.\\n\\nSince the start of the crisis, the EU\\xa0and its regional allies have spent\\xa0more than\\xa0$100 billion funding Ukraine’s defense effort, according to the Kiel Institute’s Ukraine Support Tracker.\\n\\nEarlier this month, EU leaders agreed to a $54 billion package for Ukraine between now and 2027. The United\\xa0Kingdom, arguably the major security player in the region, has also pledged\\xa0more than\\xa0$15 billion\\xa0to Ukraine since 2022. For context, according to the Kiel Institute the US has spent\\xa0$66 billion, with another $60 billion in the pipeline.\\n\\nWhile the West’s resounding support for Ukraine since 2022\\xa0has\\xa0surprised many in\\xa0the\\xa0diplomatic world, the longer the war drags on, the more the fatigue grows.\\n\\nBetween there being no end to the conflict in sight,\\xa0and\\xa0competition for political attention in the Middle East – as well as domestic concerns from inflation-led cost-of-living crises\\xa0around the world\\xa0– spending huge sums on Ukraine could become politically harder to stomach for governments.\\n\\nThe political pressure on spending will become more visible as European Parliamentary elections take place in June, as well as national polls in multiple countries including the UK, a key Ukrainian ally.\\n\\nEuropean officials need only look at the difficulty US President Joe Biden is having with his own Ukraine package to see the real-world impact of funding a costly overseas war when it comes into direct contact with domestic politics.\\n\\nAdding\\xa0to these inauspicious distractions\\xa0is\\xa0the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House next year.\\n\\nTrump has not clearly stated what his Ukraine policy would be, save his claim that he could end the war within 24 hours. The former president’s anti-NATO rhetoric, general disdain for European institutions and odd admiration for Putin are well-known.\\n\\nWhile no one knows what another Trump presidency might materially mean, it is plausible to envisage a worst-case scenario for Ukraine, where it loses momentum on the ground while the new\\xa0occupant of the White House\\xa0decides that America has spent enough already.\\n\\nThis is an alarming prospect for European officials who already believe Putin is digging in and trying to wait out the West.\\n\\nThis is where the next 12 months become crucial for Ukraine’s European allies. It is manifestly in continental Europe’s interest that Putin does not win this war – there are very few who would disagree with that sentiment.\\n\\nIt is therefore crucial, officials say, that whatever happens in America, Europeans hold their noses and keep spending, however hard it seems.\\n\\nIn the run-up to the\\xa0US\\xa0presidential election, the question of what happens to European security without America will inevitably be asked. And while it is true that Ukrainian security is directly tied to wider European security, the immediate question of how to\\xa0support\\xa0Kyiv\\xa0is subtly different to Europe’s long-term goal of greater security independence from DC.\\n\\nCan Europe continue funding Ukraine if the US pulls\\xa0financial support?\\n\\nMost officials argue that it can. It would be difficult, sure, but possible. “The EU is very good at raising funds and there are tools it hasn’t yet used,” one NATO official\\xa0told CNN.\\n\\nThe official\\xa0said\\xa0that in the next 12 months, Brussels should start to look at using money tied up in frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine. “While that money cannot legally be used to buy weapons, it can be used to cover compensation costs, freeing up money for weapons from EU and national budgets,”\\xa0they said.\\n\\nDiplomatic voices who have eyes on the world beyond Europe raise eyebrows at this. Some fear that setting a precedent for using frozen assets to raise money for foreign wars could give countries like China a green light to do the same in its internal regional battles. Beijing introduced a new law\\xa0last year\\xa0that\\xa0makes\\xa0it easier to do\\xa0similar to foreign assets within China.\\n\\nThe thornier issue is whether or not Europe could provide\\xa0Kyiv\\xa0with the weapons it needs to win the war without American support.\\n\\nThe answer to that would be no. Europe simply doesn’t have the manufacturing heft right now to independently serve Ukraine over the next 12 months.\\n\\nHowever, Western diplomats are optimistic that arming Ukraine fits perfectly with a much-needed European drive to reduce its reliance on America.\\n\\nOfficials point to a recent deal, brokered by NATO, where European countries have pledged to purchase 1,000 missiles from American firms that will be built in a new German factory.\\n\\nAlmost everyone agrees that Europe needs to buy more weapons and have a security policy that is not so reliant on the US. Achieving that needn’t come at the expense of America, and dangling the carrot of lucrative contracts for US companies is one way of ensuring everyone wins.\\n\\nPutin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is a travesty that has cost unnecessary lives. If any positives are to come from it, they should include Europe finally becoming fit to defend itself, and cooperating with its old ally.\\n\\nAnd for what it’s worth, the vast majority of Western officials believe that if Europe can spend the next year making itself fighting fit, it will be far easier to keep a future President Trump onside.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.
