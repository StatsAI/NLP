        "# The Unstructured Core API consists of the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Partitioning: The partitioning functions in Unstructured enable the extraction of structured content from raw, unstructured documents. Partitioning functions in unstructured allow users to extract structured content from a raw unstructured document. These functions break a document down into elements such as Title, NarrativeText, and ListItem, enabling users to decide what content they’d like to keep for their particular application. If you’re training a summarization model, for example, you may only be interested in NarrativeText.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cleaning: Data preparation for NLP models often requires cleaning to ensure quality. The Unstructured library includes cleaning functions that assist in sanitizing output, removing unwanted content, and improving the performance of NLP models. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity of data before it is passed to downstream applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Extracting: This functionality allows for the extraction of specific entities within documents. It is designed to identify and isolate relevant pieces of information, making it easier for users to focus on the most pertinent data in their documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Staging: Staging functions help prepare your data for ingestion into downstream systems. Please note that this functionality is being deprecated in favor of Destination Connectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Chunking: The chunking process in Unstructured is distinct from conventional methods. Instead of relying solely on text-based features to form chunks, Unstructured uses a deep understanding of document formats to partition documents into semantic units (document elements).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Embedding: The embedding encoder classes in Unstructured leverage document elements detected through partitioning or grouped via chunking to obtain embeddings for each element. This is particularly useful for applications like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where precise and contextually relevant embeddings are crucial."

            "The journalist Sergei Parkhomenko said he received a letter from Navalny on February 13, a few days before Navalny's death was announced. In the letter, which Parkhomenko shared on Facebook, Navalny spoke of books and said he only had access to classics at his new prison.\n",

            "In a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump briefly mentioned Navalny before directing his ire at his own perceived political opponents: \"The sudden death of Alexei Navalny has made me more and more aware of what is happening in our Country. It is a slow, steady progression, with CROOKED, Radical Left Politicians, Prosecutors, and Judges leading us down a path to destruction.\"\n",

Trump's public statements have raised concerns about a shift in American foreign policy towards Russia. Some of Trump's allies believe there may be a strategy behind his criticism of Ukraine, aimed at pressuring European countries to increase their support for Ukraine. European leaders are taking Trump's words seriously and are holding conferences to address the situation. Macron and the British Prime Minister have expressed support for Zelensky and are willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine.

He lied fast and furious, too.\\n\\nIn speeches, interviews, exchanges with reporters and posts on social media, the president filled his public statements not only with exaggerations but outright fabrications. As he did during his first presidency, Trump made false claims with a frequency and variety unmatched by any other elected official in Washington.\\n\\nHere is our list of Trump’s 13 biggest lies since he was inaugurated on January 20. It was hard to choose.\\n\\nThe tale of the $50 million – no, make it $100 million – in condoms for Hamas: When press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced at her first official White House briefing that Trump had thwarted a plan to spend $50 million “to fund condoms in Gaza,” it was immediately clear the claim was highly dubious; the Trump administration had no evidence to substantiate it. But Trump not only repeated the $50 million figure the next day, he added an incendiary claim that the condoms were “for Hamas.” Then, days after it had become obvious the $50 million figure was pure fiction, he inflated it to “$100 million.”\\n\\nThis was another example of Trumpflation – the president’s years-old habit of making his inaccurate stories more and more inaccurate over time.\\n\\nBlaming Ukraine for starting the war on Ukraine: Russia started the war in Ukraine when it invaded Ukraine in 2022. That is an obvious fact. But on Tuesday, when Trump dismissed Ukrainians’ complaints about their exclusion from US-Russia negotiations about ending the war, he falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war – saying, “You should’ve never started it. You could’ve made a deal.” Laughable Kremlin-style propaganda, this time from the president of the United States.\\n\\nThe (non-)uniqueness of birthright citizenship: Trump offered what might have sounded like a reasonable rationale for his attempt to get rid of birthright citizenship. The United States, he said, is the only country that has birthright citizenship.\\n\\nExcept that is not true, as CNN and other outlets pointed out when Trump made the same claim as president in 2018 and on various other occasions. Dozens of countries, including Canada and Mexico, also grant automatic citizenship to people born on their soil.\\n\\nMore up-is-down reversing of the reality of January 6: For years now, Trump has presented a version of the Capitol riot of January 6, 2021, that bears little resemblance to what actually happened. When he was asked in early February why he granted pardons to people who assaulted first responders, he said the people he pardoned were actually “assaulted by our government” and that “they didn’t assault.” This “they didn’t assault” claim was a brazen denial of the obvious truth, clear in video after video and trial after trial. The Justice Department has said more than 140 officers were assaulted on January 6, and that more than 170 people pleaded guilty to such assaults.\\n\\nA gusher of deceit about California water policy: Amid disaster, more dishonesty. First, Trump linked the Los Angeles wildfires to California’s decision to use some of its water to protect a fish species in the northern part of the state – even though the two things have nothing to do with each other, as befuddled experts explained to anyone who would listen. Then, after ordering the sudden release of billions of gallons of water from Central Valley reservoirs for no apparent good reason, Trump declared that some of this water was heading to Los Angeles – even though it wasn’t heading to Los Angeles and couldn’t go to Los Angeles.\\n\\nThe election lie he refused to let die: What can you even say about this one at this point? Trump’s win in the free and fair 2024 election did not convince him to abandon his endless lying about his defeat in the free and fair 2020 election. More than four years after his loss to Joe Biden, he repeated his “rigged” nonsense during at least three events on his 2025 inauguration day alone, then a bunch of times after that.\\n\\nThat fable about Olympic boxers, again: Trump, once a prominent promoter of lies about President Barack Obama’s birthplace, continued to demonstrate no hesitation lying about not only policy issues but also individual people. This time, to promote his push to try to get transgender athletes banned from the Olympics, he told his familiar story about how two gold medalists in women’s boxing at the Games in Paris last year were men who “transitioned.”\\n\\nWrong. As the International Olympic Committee repeatedly noted during the Olympics, when Trump and others made such claims, neither champion had transitioned; both were born as female and have always competed in women’s events. Even the discredited boxing authority that controversially disqualified the women from a 2023 competition, vaguely claiming a test had found they had unfair competitive advantages, did not allege they had transitioned.\\n\\nThe president’s fictionalized northern neighbor: Before taking office, Trump casually asserted that the Canadian people “like” his idea of Canada becoming the 51st US state. That was the opposite of the truth; the idea is hugely unpopular with the Canadian public. Then, after his inauguration, Trump continued to make stuff up about Canada – at one point posting on social media and then saying out loud that Canada prohibits US banks from doing business there. He added, “Can you believe that?” No doubt some Americans believe it, but it’s false.\\n\\nBlasting Biden for a program launched under Trump: After the deadly January collision between a military helicopter and a passenger jet, Trump blamed Biden administration diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration without providing any evidence any FAA diversity policy had anything to do with the crash. He added in a fictional story about a frantic last-minute Biden push to hire people with significant disabilities as air traffic controllers, failing to explain that this FAA pilot program was actually a years-old initiative launched during his own administration in 2019.\\n\\nRelentless deception about who pays tariffs: When Trump talked about the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports in his first presidency, he spoke of how much money “from China” these tariffs generated for the US Treasury. When he talked about the additional tariffs he plans to impose on various other countries during his current presidency, he spoke of a need to “charge them.” At no point did he acknowledge that US importers, not foreign countries, are the ones who pay the actual tariff charges – or that study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan trade commission, found that Americans ended up bearing almost the entire cost of his first-term tariffs on Chinese products.\\n\\nA wild exaggeration of the increase in autism rates: Trump keeps flirting with, though not explicitly endorsing, the thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory that childhood vaccines cause autism – and in a social media post in early February, he inflated the extent of the increase in the known prevalence of autism over the last two decades. “20 years ago, Autism in children was 1 in 10,000. NOW IT’S 1 in 34,” Trump wrote. “WOW! Something’s really wrong.” Aside from the fact that experts say the increase in autism diagnoses (to 1 in 36 children by age 8 in 2020) likely has to do with greater awareness of the symptoms and improved screening practices, public statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the known prevalence in 2004 was 1 in 125 children, not “1 in 10,000.” That’s a pretty big difference.\\n\\nChina’s (non-)operation of the Panama Canal: Much of Trump’s lying is ad-libbed. Some of it, however, is planned in advance. Some of it, however, is written into his prepared speeches. He said in his inaugural address in January: “Above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.”\\n\\nThis would have been a good line if China was actually operating the Panama Canal. It isn’t; Panama is, though Trump could have raised legitimate questions about China’s influence in the area.\\n\\nTrump’s invented dominance with “the youth vote”: Trump said some accurate things while touting his victory in the 2024 election, such as the fact that he swept all seven swing states. But in keeping with his longstanding practice of exaggerating even legitimate accomplishments, he also kept sprinkling in a claim that wasn’t even close to correct – an assertion that he won the youth vote “by 36 points.” In fact, exit polls show he lost the youth vote to then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Even if these polls were off, there’s no basis for the claim that he won the youth vote by 36.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

He’s not going to have a country left.”\\n\\nBoth accusations parroted Moscow’s own irony-laden talking points about the war and Ukraine’s president, who declared martial law at the onset of Russia’s invasion, which prevented scheduled elections.\\n\\nTrump’s post was hardly an isolated attack. For years, Trump has viewed Zelensky skeptically, questioning his decisions and — in an episode made famous during Trump’s first impeachment — pressing him to open an investigation into his then-rival Joe Biden.\\n\\nTrump has taken to weaving his criticism of Biden and Zelensky together, suggesting Wednesday night that the Ukrainian president was on a “gravy train” with US assistance during the Biden administration.\\n\\n“If you would have had (Biden’s) administration for another year,” Trump said Wednesday night, “you would have been in World War III and it’s not going to happen now.”\\n\\nLately, however, Trump’s aides have been closely monitoring Zelensky’s public statements — in particular his criticism of the US excluding Ukraine from talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia this week — with mounting agitation.\\n\\nTheir frustration had been growing before Wednesday, sources said. But it boiled over after Zelensky told reporters at his office in Kyiv that Trump was living in a “web of disinformation.”\\n\\nTrump privately told aides who were with him in Florida that he wanted to respond directly, which led to his Truth Social post, an official traveling with Trump said. He delivered the diplomatic missile on the way to his golf club in Miami and expanded on his remarks before an audience of hundreds at the evening investment conference in Miami sponsored by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, which hosted talks earlier in the week between US and Russian officials.\\n\\n“It’s a frustration. There is a strong and legitimate feeling that this brutal war has to stop and that this pathway is being diminished through Zelensky’s public statements,” a second White House official told CNN.\\n\\nIn Zelensky’s view, however, the end to the war Trump is envisioning looks a lot like what Russia has been asking for. Already, members of Trump’s administration have ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv and said US troops would not help guarantee Ukraine’s security when the war ends.\\n\\nFor those reasons, he says he can’t help but speak out.\\n\\nFor months, Zelensky had carefully sought to avoid a full rupture with his temperamental new counterpart in Washington. He arranged a meeting in the weeks ahead of last year’s election meant to allay some of the then-GOP nominee’s skepticism about US involvement in the war.\\n\\nThe men emerged at the start of the discussion at Trump Tower in Manhattan to demonstrate their willingness to get along. Trump said he had a “very good relationship” with the Ukrainian leader — but that he also enjoyed a “very good relationship” with his adversary in Moscow, Vladimir Putin.\\n\\n“I hope we have more good relations,” Zelensky interjected.\\n\\n“But, you know, it takes two to tango,” Trump replied.\\n\\nAt the time, the exchange hardly registered. Five months later, it appears to foretell the remarkable rift that is emerging just as Trump looks to sit down with Putin in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nSignaling a shift in American policy\\n\\nFew foreign leaders have been immune to Trump’s mood swings, which during his first term led to scrapped overseas trips, phone calls ended abruptly when Trump hung up, and the imposition of tough new tariffs.\\n\\nYet until now, Trump’s frustrations hadn’t seemed to signal such a wholesale shift in American foreign policy, away from the United States’ longstanding allies in Europe and toward the Kremlin.\\n\\nMany of Trump’s allies said Zelensky should have seen Trump’s wrath coming.\\n\\n“The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president’s mind by badmouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,” Vance told The Daily Mail.\\n\\nIn explaining Trump’s striking public statements, White House officials have insisted his primary – in fact, only – objective is to end the three-year conflict in Ukraine, which he believes was woefully mismanaged by the previous administration.\\n\\nInsisting upon a settlement to the war, they say, is long overdue after years of grinding conflict. Trump himself has appeared almost agnostic on the precise contours of the settlement that would end the war: “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed, killed,” he said last week.\\n\\nYet how he achieves that objective while castigating Zelensky and aligning himself with Russian talking points isn’t clear.\\n\\nTrump’s Republican allies in Washington suggested Wednesday the president may have a grand plan in mind.\\n\\n”What I’m in support of is a peaceful outcome and result in Ukraine,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said when asked if he had concerns about the president’s rhetoric about Ukraine. Thune said he believed Trump and his team are working to achieve peace and “right now, you’ve got to give them some space.”\\n\\nSen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, said Trump is “always positioning for something,” adding that he suspected Trump might be “positioning for a negotiation” with Putin through his comments about Zelensky.\\n\\nStill, Trump will require buy-in from Zelensky if any negotiated end to the conflict is successful. And if he is serious about keeping American troops out of the conflict, he’ll need European allies to step up with their own peacekeeping troops — a step some nations have already offered.\\n\\nSome Trump advisers and allies do see a strategy in the bluster. A Trump loyalist who has spoken to the president in Florida in recent days said one reason behind Trump’s lashing out at Ukraine is to scare Europe into ponying up more to defend Ukraine.\\n\\n“See, there’s a method to the madness,” the person said, pointing to a report that Denmark had pledged to boost spending on arms.\\n\\nA Trump advisor echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, telling CNN: “If other European countries are half as responsive as Denmark, then that’s a massive win.”\\n\\nWriting on X, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson — who maintained close ties with Trump during his first term — rebutted most of Trump’s claims but said his former counterpart was driving a larger point.\\n\\n“When are we Europeans going to stop being scandalised about Donald Trump and start helping him to end this war?” Johnson wrote. “Of course Ukraine didn’t start the war. You might as well say that America attacked Japan at Pearl Harbor. Of course a country undergoing a violent invasion should not be staging elections. There was no general election in the UK from 1935 to 1945. Of course Zelenskyy’s ratings are not 4%. They are actually about the same as Trump’s.”\\n\\n“Trump’s statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action,” he went on.\\n\\nIndeed, hastily arranged conferences of European leaders in Paris this week hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron suggested Trump’s words were being taken very seriously.\\n\\n“Russia poses an existential threat to Europeans,” Macron said in an interview with French regional newspapers. “Do not think that the unthinkable cannot happen, including the worst.”\\n\\nAt the same time, Macron is not giving up on Trump entirely. He will be in Washington next week for a meeting, as will British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has said he would be willing to send troops to act as peacekeepers in Ukraine.\\n\\nBoth men spoke to Zelensky on Wednesday following Trump’s insults.\\n\\n“The Prime Minister expressed his support for President Zelenskyy as Ukraine’s democratically elected leader and said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II,” Downing Street said afterward.\\n\\nTrump is increasingly casting himself in the role of peacemaker – no matter the cost – overlooking the frayed western alliances and the upending of US foreign policy.\\n\\n“We’re successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia, something all admit that only Trump is going to be able to do,” Trump said Wednesday night, speaking about himself again and again in the third person.\\n\\n“In the Trump administration, we’re going to be able to do it. I think Putin even admitted that.”\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

But there was hope the greater good of both the US and Ukraine would win out.\\n\\nThe past 24 hours has seen US President Donald Trump’s slow-burn, apparent dislike for his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, belch out into the open. And with it comes a real and new uncertainty about the future of Ukraine, and more widely the security of Europe.\\n\\nLast week, Trump hinted he felt Zelensky’s poll numbers were low and he would have to face elections, but Tuesday night he dug deeper, falsely stating the wartime leader was at 4 per cent favorability and Ukraine had started the war.\\n\\nThis is pretty close to Kremlin talking points. Moscow has been at pains to incorrectly suggest Ukraine’s imminent joining of NATO was behind its unprovoked attack in 2022, and that Zelensky is illegitimate as Ukraine has not undertaken the immense challenge of running elections in wartime.\\n\\nZelensky has for months flattered Trump as one who can bring peace through strength. Kyiv knew the Trump team’s rhetoric on the campaign trail spelt a likely sea change for Ukraine, but held out hope, with European allies, that Trump would seek to avoid a Kabul Airport Moment of collapse in security on the continent, and keep Russia back.\\n\\nIn the background, lingered the risk their contentious relationship in Trump’s first term – when Zelensky didn’t give Trump what he wanted in a “perfect” phone call that led to impeachment – was a dark, inescapable cloud that would hang over their future interactions. Now that cloud has loudly broken and Ukraine is getting wet.\\n\\nZelensky has tempered his remarks about Trump living in a “disinformation space” by adding he has great respect for this US president and the American people. But Trump sought no such caveats, even adding the “dictator” needed to move fast to save Ukraine and was on a “gravy train.”\\n\\nTwice in five days this White House has dubbed European democratic leaders tyrants, falsely, while declining to mention the Kremlin’s authoritarian record in the same speech. US Vice President JD Vance at the weekend in Munich said Europe’s most democratic US allies were afraid of their voters. Now Trump says Russia’s greatest adversary is himself a “dictator” on the make. Putin’s army of propagandists are being outwritten on Pennsylvania Avenue.\\n\\nThe existential dilemma now for Ukraine is whether it even has the luxury of choice between its wartime president and its main military backer, the United States. Is enough left intact of either?\\n\\nZelensky is now the subject of withering posts by the world’s most powerful man, who is parroting a regular supply of Kremlin talking points stemming from somewhere yet unknown, altering the course of the largest war in Europe since the 1940s.\\n\\nThe Trump administration’s financial support for Ukraine – without which its survival is truly in doubt – is now endangered. Trump has repeatedly referred – falsely – to how Ukraine’s aid is “MISSING,” and somehow that Zelensky is on a “gravy train.” He is preparing a narrative for the American people that probably ends in the aid itself being curtailed.\\n\\nSo why doesn’t Zelensky, who has spent half of his six years in power fighting a war he did not initially believe was going to happen, just call a vote and be done with talk of his legitimacy? Elections in Ukraine have been tough in the past two decades, even in peacetime. Russia has sought to meddle, in 2004 stealing the vote and sparking huge protests that unseated its proxy candidate who stole the vote.\\n\\nIn wartime, elections are suspended during martial law. A ceasefire, proposed also by Trump’s team, could lead to this being suspended, and allowing soldiers to vote. But what of the millions of Ukrainians abroad as refugees? What of the electoral reform and emergency legislation needed for a legitimate, modern vote? Should it be rushed to get a quick result, or labored over to reach the full, gold standards of international legitimacy? What if a Russian drone assault or missiles derail the voting day? Everything could go wrong and almost certainly will.\\n\\nThe result would irrevocably be shrouded in doubt, further damaging the mandate Zelensky is falsely accused of lacking, or empowering an alternative who would also lack full legitimacy. It would sow chaos on the front lines, at the kitchen tables and in the coffee shops of Kyiv, and in the Ukrainian diaspora around Europe. This is exactly what the Kremlin wants: political torment to add to Kyiv’s woes across the front line.\\n\\nIt is becoming harder to divine Trump’s motives. You cannot bluff when it comes to geopolitical security and NATO; your opponents will hear weakness in an alliance, and not fear you more as you strike a hard negotiating pose against your own allies. You cannot force a flawed peace upon a country fearing for the survival of its own borders and people. You cannot undermine a wartime leader and not expect his troops to also falter on the front lines. Only one strategic interest has been served by Trump’s radical rewriting of the global order in the past fortnight. And it is that of the one adversary NATO was founded to confront.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

              "  Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lite.cnn.com//2025/02/20/politics/cnn-poll-trump-approval/index.html'}, page_content='CNN 2/20/2025\\n\\nCNN Poll: Americans worried by Trump’s push to expand power\\n\\nBy Jennifer Agiesta, CNN\\n\\nUpdated: 9:39 AM EST, Thu February 20, 2025\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nAt the one-month mark of Donald Trump’s second term as president, his approval rating in a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS tilts negative but still lands above the level he reached at any point in his first four years in office.\\n\\nThere are signs in the poll, though, that the warmer welcome Trump has received this time around could be fleeting, as optimism about his return to office has slipped since December. A broad majority feel the president isn’t doing enough to address the high prices of everyday goods. And 52% say he’s gone too far in using his presidential power, with similar majorities wary of his push to shutter federal agencies and elevate Elon Musk to a prominent role in his efforts to reshape the government.\\n\\nAmericans divide on Trump’s performance in office thus far, with 47% approving and 52% disapproving, below the start-of-term ratings for any recent presidency other than his own. For most of the public, Trump’s actions are lining up with their expectations: Three-quarters say his handling of the presidency has been in line with what they expected while 25% say he’s handled it in an unexpected way, similar to how people felt a few weeks into his first term.\\n\\nAll told, 41% say both that Trump is handling the presidency as expected and that his living up to their expectations is a positive. Nearly all of those who feel caught off guard describe that as a bad thing, but the group who feels surprised in a bad way by Trump’s actions makes up only 21% of all Americans.\\n\\nPessimism on the rise\\n\\nMost adults nationwide, 55%, say that Trump has not paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems and 62% feel he has not gone far enough in trying to reduce the price of everyday goods. Sizable shares across party lines share the latter view, including 47% of Republicans, 65% of independents and 73% of Democrats. In CNN’s January polling, the economy eclipsed all other issues as Americans’ top concern.\\n\\nMore describe themselves as pessimistic or afraid when looking ahead to the rest of Trump’s second term (54%) than say they feel enthusiastic or optimistic about it (46%). In December, 52% were on the positive side, 48% negative. Notably, the share saying they feel “afraid” has climbed 6 points to 35%, rising by a roughly equal share across partisan lines.\\n\\nTrump’s support also appears to be fading among some traditionally Democratic-leaning demographic groups with whom he made inroads in last year’s election. A January CNN poll found that 57% of 18–34-year-olds, 50% of Hispanic adults and 30% of Black adults approved of the way he was handling the presidential transition. Now that Trump has taken office, his approval ratings with those groups stand at 41% among younger and Hispanic adults and 23% among Black adults.\\n\\nHispanic and Black adults are notably more likely than Whites to also say that Trump has handled the presidency in a way they did not expect (35% among Hispanic adults and 30% among Black adults compared with 20% among White adults), and to see that as a bad thing (29% among Hispanic people and 24% among Black people vs. 16% among White people).\\n\\nWariness of Trump’s push for power\\n\\nAbout half of all Americans feel that Trump has overstepped in using the power of the presidency and the executive branch (52% say he has gone too far in doing so, 39% that he’s been about right and 8% that he hasn’t gone far enough). Broad majorities of Democrats (87%) and independents (57%) see him as going too far in using the presidency’s powers. Republicans largely disagree but few of Trump’s own partisans are clamoring for him to go further than he has already: 75% say his use of presidential power has been about right, 11% think he’s gone too far and 13% that he hasn’t gone far enough.\\n\\nSizable shares are skeptical about his efforts to trim government programs and shut down federal agencies. About half (48%) say he’s gone too far in changing the way the US government works, with 32% saying his approach has been about right and 19% that it hasn’t gone far enough. Larger shares say he’s gone too far in cutting federal government programs (51%), that it’s a bad thing that he has attempted to shut down entire agencies such as the US Agency for International Development and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (53%) and that it’s bad he gave Musk a prominent role in his administration (54%).\\n\\nTrump’s suggestion that the US take over Gaza and keep Palestinians from returning there is the least popular of the early proposals he’s put forth that were tested in the poll. Overall, 58% call that a bad idea, including 86% of Democrats, 60% of independents and 27% of Republicans. A plurality of Republicans take a neutral position on it (47% call it neither good nor bad), and just 26% call it a good thing.\\n\\nSome of the president’s early moves, though, draw more muted opposition. On deporting immigrants living in the US illegally, 39% say Trump’s approach has been about right with another 16% saying he hasn’t gone far enough, together outpacing the 45% who say Trump has gone too far on that score. And 42% call it a bad thing that Trump has sought to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the federal government, modestly outpacing the 37% saying it’s a good thing, with 20% neutral on the matter.\\n\\nFrustrated opposition\\n\\nDemocrats and Democratic-leaning independents are broadly dissatisfied with the response to Trump by Democrats in Congress. Nearly three-quarters (73%) say the party’s caucus in Congress is doing too little to oppose Trump, with just 22% saying they’re doing the right amount and 5% that they’re overdoing it.\\n\\nRepublicans and Republican-aligned independents, meanwhile, largely see the congressional GOP as doing the right amount to back the president (64%), with another 24% saying they do too little to support him and 12% too much. Republican-aligned adults of color are somewhat more likely than White adults who are Republican-aligned to say the party is doing too much to support Trump (21% among Republicans/Republican-leaning independents of color vs. 8% among Republican-aligned Whites).\\n\\nThe sense of urgency Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents feel is evident in their views on the stakes of Trump’s time in office. In the new poll, 70% of Democratic-aligned adults said they view American democracy as under attack, up from 49% who felt that way in the fall of 2023, and 63% say they feel afraid as they look ahead to the rest of Trump’s term. Democratic-aligned adults who say democracy is under attack are far more likely than other Democratic-leaners to say their party’s response to Trump is inadequate (82% say so compared with 58% among those who feel democracy is under threat rather than attack).\\n\\nThat view from the left contrasts sharply with the view from the GOP. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, just 23% see American democracy as under attack, down from 61% who said the same about a year and a half ago, and 87% describe themselves as either enthusiastic or optimistic about Trump’s coming time in office.\\n\\nWith many of the Trump administration’s early actions already facing legal challenges, the poll also finds few Americans have deep trust in the Supreme Court to make the right decisions on any legal cases relating to the Trump administration. Just 41% overall have at least a moderate amount of trust in the high court, peaking at 66% among Republicans. But few in any party express a great deal of trust in the Court to handle any cases on the subject: 19% of Republicans, 7% of independents and 6% of Democrats feel that way.\\n\\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from February 13-17 among a random national sample of 1,206 adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2025 Cable News Network.
